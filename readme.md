# PrivIC

PrivIC [pronounced privacy] is an “open internet service” providing identity management on the IC.

Users can directly visit the PrivIC app to manage their identity which consists of attributes such as, name, date of birth, email, and phone number, or as part of the register/sign-in flow from an app. They can also grant (and subsequently revoke) access to any of these attributes to requesting apps.

Apps on the IC can integrate directly with PrivIC to authenticate their users and request access to specific identity attributes.

To access PrivIC directly visit [this url](https://q3fc5-haaaa-aaaaa-aaahq-cai.nnsdapp.dfinity.network/) which is currently running on a dfinity testnet so requires VPN access.

To see an example of an app using PrivIC for authentication visit [this url](https://sgymv-uiaaa-aaaaa-aaaia-cai.nnsdapp.dfinity.network/) which is a modified version of OpenChat v2 (in development). This is running on the same internal testnet.
